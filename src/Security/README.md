Security
========

Contains the security and authorization middlewares for ASP.NET Core.

A list of community projects related to authentication and security for ASP.NET Core are listed in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/community).

### Notes

ASP.NET Security will not include Basic Authentication middleware due to its potential insecurity and performance problems. If you host under IIS you can enable it via IIS configuration.
